# Expected Data:

To populate this folder with hOCR directories, use the `hocr_applier.py` file with each of the directories in `data/ocr/images/csel`.
The hOCR files that we used, with slight alterations to change the path corresponding to each image file listed in each hOCR file,
are available in XAR files suffixed with "texts" given in `data/ocr/xar/csel`.
