# Expected Data:

To populate this folder with image directories, use the `pdf_converter.py` file with each of the PDFs in `data/ocr/pdf/csel`.
We also make the images that we used explicitly available in our sister repository, the Corpus Correctum.
Additionally, the original images we used are available in XAR files suffixed with "images" under `data/ocr/xar/csel`.
