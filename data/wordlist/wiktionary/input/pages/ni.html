<p>The verb in Navajo incorporates information about person, and many sentences may thus not have explicit independent pronouns. For instance:
</p>
<ul><li>Hooghandi naniná.</li>
<li>Ni éí hooghandi naniná.</li></ul>
<p>Both sentences are grammatically complete, and mean essentially the same thing: <i>you are at home.</i> The verb <i>naniná</i> is in the second-person form, so the pronoun can be safely omitted, as in the first sentence. This is similar to pronoun dropping in other languages where the verb specifies person, such as Spanish. Meanwhile, the explicit use of <b>ni</b> in the second sentence emphasizes that the speaker is talking about <i>you</i>. This can be thought of as roughly equivalent to the use of emphasis in English: while the first sentence comes across as <i>you're at home</i>, the second one is more like <i>you, you're at home</i>.

<p>Both <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv">ni</i> and <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/er#Swedish" title="er">er</a></i> are second person plural forms, but can also be used as formal second person singular, as in the German <i class="Latn mention" lang="de"><a href="/wiki/Sie#German" title="Sie">Sie</a></i> or French <i class="Latn mention" lang="de"><a href="/wiki/vous#German" title="vous">vous</a></i>. It may sometimes also be capitalized (<i>Ni</i>, <i>Er</i>). The courteous "ni" was introduced in Swedish around the year 1900 as an alternative to the more complicated pattern of addressing others in the third person singular by their appropriate titles. This required knowledge of social status, occupation, educations, etc. with terms like <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/fru#Swedish" title="fru">fru</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss"><a href="/wiki/Mrs" title="Mrs">Mrs</a>.</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span> or <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/fr%C3%B6ken#Swedish" title="fröken">fröken</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss"><a href="/wiki/Ms" title="Ms">Ms</a>.</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/greve#Swedish" title="greve">greve</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">count</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/kamrer#Swedish" title="kamrer">kamrer</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss">accountant</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/kandidat#Swedish" title="kandidat">kandidat</a></i> <span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">(</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">“</span><span class="mention-gloss"><a href="/wiki/bachelor%27s_degree" title="bachelor&#39;s degree">bachelor's degree</a> holder</span><span class="mention-gloss-double-quote">”</span><span class="mention-gloss-paren annotation-paren">)</span>, etc. However this "ni-reform" was not well liked and when authority came to use the word <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv">ni</i> to their subordinates the word got a condescending undertone. Interestingly enough the older <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/I#Swedish" title="I">I</a></i>, from which <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv">ni</i> was originally formed, was used alongside <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv">ni</i> all along (and is still in use in some dialects) but never got the condescending undertone that <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv">ni</i> got. This was all phased out gradually during the 1960s and 1970s in the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/du-reformen" class="extiw" title="w:du-reformen">du-reformen</a>, (“the you-reform”). In contemporary Swedish, <i class="Latn mention" lang="sv"><a href="/wiki/du#Swedish" title="du">du</a></i> is universal and may be used to address anyone, regardless of differences in social status or age.
</p><p><i>Ni</i> is used occasionally by younger speakers to address customers in order to be formal and polite. However this is often seen as being overly formal and too contrived, even condescending and insulting, especially by older speakers. Formality and politeness in modern Swedish is not conveyed through specific grammatical forms, but primarily done through indirectness, manners of speaking or various other behaviors.
